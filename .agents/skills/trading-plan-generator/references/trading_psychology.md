- "This trade WILL work"
- "I know what market will do"
- "I can't be wrong"

**Right thinking:**

- "I don't know, but R:R is good"
- "I can be wrong and still profitable"

- Daily P&L
- "How much did I make?"

**Right focus:**

- "Did I execute well?"
- Personal improvement

## Handling Losses

### Accept Losses as Business Cost

### Learn from Every Loss

**After each loss ask:**
- Did I follow my plan?

- What can I improve?

**Categories of losses:**
1. **Good loss:** Followed plan, just didn't work
2. **Bad loss:** Broke rules

**Good losses are OK. Learn from bad ones.**
