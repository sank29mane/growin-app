## Risk Management Frameworks

### The 1% Rule (Recommended for Most Traders)
**Never risk more than 1% of account on single trade**

**Example:**
- Account size: $50,000
- Maximum risk per trade: $500 (1%)
- Stock entry: $100
- Stop-loss: $98
- Risk per share: $2
- Position size: $500 / $2 = 250 shares
- Total position: $25,000 (50% of account)
- Actual risk: $500 (1% of account)

**Benefits:**
- Can survive 20+ consecutive losses
- Removes emotion from sizing
- Consistent risk across trades
- Protects capital

### The 2R Minimum Rule
**Only take trades with 2:1 reward-to-risk or better**

**Example:**
- Entry: $100
- Stop: $98 (risk = $2)
- Target: $104 (reward = $4)
- R:R = 2:1 ✅

**Why it matters:**
- Can be profitable with 40% win rate
- Forces selective trading
- Improves overall edge

### Maximum Drawdown Limit
**Hard stop trading if down X% from peak**

**Recommendations:**
- Conservative: 10% drawdown → stop trading
- Moderate: 15% drawdown → stop trading
- Aggressive: 20% drawdown → stop trading

**When hit:**
1. Stop trading immediately
2. Review all trades
3. Identify mistakes
4. Paper trade until recovered mentally
5. Resume with reduced size

## Position Sizing Formulas

### Fixed Dollar Risk
```
Position Size = Account Risk $ / (Entry - Stop)

Example:
- Account: $50,000
- Risk per trade: $500 (1%)
- Entry: $100
- Stop: $97
- Risk per share: $3
- Shares: $500 / $3 = 166 shares
```

### Fixed Percentage Risk
```
Position Size = (Account × Risk %) / (Entry - Stop)

Example:
- Account: $50,000
- Risk: 1%
- Entry: $50
- Stop: $48
- Risk per share: $2
- Shares: ($50,000 × 0.01) / $2 = 250 shares
```

### Kelly Criterion (Advanced)
```
Position Size % = (Win Rate × Avg Win - Loss Rate × Avg Loss) / Avg Win

Example:
- Win rate: 55%
- Avg win: $500
- Loss rate: 45%
- Avg loss: $300
- Kelly: (0.55 × $500 - 0.45 × $300) / $500 = 28%
- Use 1/4 Kelly = 7% position size (conservative)
```

**Warning:** Kelly can be aggressive, use fractional Kelly
