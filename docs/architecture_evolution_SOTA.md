# Growin App Multi-Agent System: Architecture Evolution (SOTA 2026)

## 1. Executive Summary
As of Phase 20, the Growin App has transitioned from a hierarchical, multi-hop Multi-Agent System (MAS) to a flattened, high-performance architecture. This evolution eliminates redundant LLM reasoning stages, implements strict risk governance via the **Critic Pattern and ACE Scoring**, introduces **Multi-Account Synergy** with **Tax-Loss Harvesting (TLH)**, and leverages **8-bit AFFINE hardware acceleration** for Apple Silicon M4 Pro.

## 2. Evolution: From Hierarchical to Flattened

### Previous Architecture (Phase 1-15)
1. **User** -> **Decision Agent**
2. **Decision Agent** -> **Coordinator Agent** (Routing)
3. **Coordinator** -> **Swarm** (Specialists)
4. **Swarm** -> **Coordinator** (Results)
5. **Coordinator** -> **Decision Agent** (Synthesis)
6. **Decision Agent** -> **User** (Final Response)
*Latency: High (~3-5s overhead per hop)*

### Current SOTA 2026 Architecture (Phase 16-20)
1. **User** -> **Orchestrator Agent**: Unified entry point for intent classification and final reasoning.
2. **Orchestrator** -> **Specialist Swarm**: Parallel execution of Quant, Research, Portfolio, etc.
3. **Specialist Swarm** -> **Orchestrator**: Raw data injection into MarketContext.
4. **Orchestrator** -> **Risk Agent (Critic)**: Mandatory audit of the proposed strategy using a multi-turn Adversarial Confidence Estimation (ACE) loop.
5. **Risk Agent** -> **Orchestrator**: Compliance approval or risk flagging.
6. **Orchestrator** -> **User**: Unified stitched response with real-time AG-UI streaming.
*Latency: Optimized (<500ms routing overhead)*

## 3. Core SOTA Components

### A. The Unified Orchestrator (`orchestrator_agent.py`)
Merges the functions of the previous Decision and Coordinator agents. It manages the full lifecycle:
- **Intent Classification**: Uses lightweight models (Granite-Tiny) for sub-100ms routing.
- **Data Fabrication**: Orchestrates the Specialist Swarm via `asyncio.gather`.
- **Trajectory Stitching**: Dynamically merges disparate specialist signals into a coherent narrative.
- **Dynamic Weighting**: Biases the synthesis prompt based on historical alpha metrics retrieved from DuckDB.

### B. The Critic Pattern & ACE (`risk_agent.py` & `ace_evaluator.py`)
Implements mandatory governance. Every strategy synthesized by the Orchestrator must pass through the Risk Agent for:
- **Exposure Auditing**: Checking portfolio concentration limits.
- **Adversarial Debate**: Risk Agent acts as 'The Contrarian', forcing the Orchestrator to defend or revise its thesis.
- **ACE Scoring**: Quantifies the robustness of the strategy based on the outcome of the debate.

### C. Multi-Account Synergy & TLH (`portfolio_agent.py` & `tlh_scanner.py`)
- **Consolidation**: Merges holdings across Invest, ISA, and CFD accounts for global weighting.
- **Tax-Loss Harvesting (TLH)**: Automatically flags losing positions in taxable accounts for potential offset strategies.
- **Wash-Sale Gate**: Risk Agent blocks repurchasing of harvested assets within a 30-day window.

### D. 8-bit AFFINE Hardware Optimization
Optimized for Apple Silicon M4 Pro (NPU/GPU):
- **AFFINE Quantization**: Implemented in `mlx_engine.py` to maximize throughput while maintaining reasoning precision.
- **NPU Affinity**: Routing models are pinned to the ANE (Apple Neural Engine) to free the GPU for large-model reasoning.

### E. AG-UI Streaming Protocol
Real-time transparency via `AgentMessenger`:
- **Granular Telemetry**: Broadcasts `intent_classified`, `swarm_started`, and `risk_review_started` events.
- **SwiftUI Integration**: Live reasoning traces using `PhaseAnimator` for fluid, transparent AI thought visualization.

## 4. Governance & Safety Gates

### Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Enforcement
Trading execution is protected by a dual-layered gate:
1. **Agent Gate**: Risk Agent appends `[ACTION_REQUIRED:TRADE_APPROVAL]` to any sensitive suggestion.
2. **Backend Gate**: `/mcp/tool/call` requires a signed HMAC `approval_token` generated by the UI after explicit user confirmation.
