# Plan 19.02: Trajectory Stitching & Dynamic Weighting

## Objective
Update OrchestratorAgent to 'Stitch' multiple specialist outputs into a single unified timeline and apply dynamic weighting based on AnalyticsDB alpha metrics.

## Tasks

<task type="auto">
  <name>Implement Trajectory Stitcher</name>
  <status>DONE</status>
  <files>backend/utils/trajectory_stitcher.py</files>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Implement Dynamic Alpha Weighting</name>
  <status>DONE</status>
  <files>backend/agents/orchestrator_agent.py</files>
</task>

## Must-Haves
- [x] Recommendation includes a 'Stitched Reasoning' section.
- [x] Reasoning prompt dynamically includes alpha-based weights.

## Success Criteria
- [x] Latency remains under 2s for the full loop.
- [x] Response coherence is significantly improved.
