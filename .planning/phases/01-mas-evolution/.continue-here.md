<current_state>
We have just completed the core implementation of the MAS strategy (Phases 1 & 2). The system has high-precision financial math, agentic debate, structured telemetry, and a decoupled messenger bus. All pending PRs have been merged and pushed to main.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Research Synthesis: Gathered SOTA MAS finance trends in NotebookLM.
- Strategy Definition: Created MAS_Strategy.md.
- Precision Layer: Migrated QuantEngine, DataFabricator, and PortfolioAgent to Decimal arithmetic.
- Observability: Implemented TelemetryData and end-to-end tracing in BaseAgent.
- Agentic Debate: Enhanced DecisionAgent to identify and resolve specialist contradictions.
- Communication Bus: Implemented AgentMessenger and GovernanceService (Actor-model).
- Documentation: Updated README.md and ARCHITECTURE.md with diagrams and intricate details.
- CI/CD: Resolved conflicts and merged PRs #75-#82.
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Phase 2: Standardize 8-bit AFFINE quantization for local LLMs on M4 Pro.
- Phase 2: Refactor agent permissions UI / HITL gates for high-impact actions.
- Phase 3: Scenario Simulation Meetings (Bull/Bear debates).
- Phase 3: Autonomous Goal Rebalancing.
- Phase 3: Whale Watch 2.0 real-time tracking.
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Migration to Decimal is mandatory for all financial data paths to ensure 100% accuracy.
- Decentralized communication (Messenger bus) is preferred over direct agent coupling for scalability.
- DecisionAgent acts as a Moderator/Refiner in a "Debate Consensus" model rather than a simple aggregator.
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- None: All tests passed and code is in a stable, pushed state.
</blockers>

<context>
The architecture has shifted from a centralized "God Object" Coordinator to a Collaborative Swarm. Agents are now "Workflow Integrated Operators" capable of secure, authorized communication. The next focus is on hardware efficiency (quantization) and advanced autonomous features (rebalancing).
</context>

<next_action>
Start with: Evaluate the current quantization of local models (Granite-Tiny, Phi-3) and establish a standardized 8-bit AFFINE optimization path for the M4 Pro.
