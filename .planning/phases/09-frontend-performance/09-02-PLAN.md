<objective>
Implement comprehensive accessibility support for financial charts and agentic traces, including tabular/descriptive fallbacks, correct focus order, and high-contrast mode verification.
</objective>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Accessible Charts with Data Fallbacks</name>
  <action>
    - Add `accessibilityRepresentation` to SwiftUI Charts in `PortfolioView` and `StockChartView`.
    - Provide accessible chart data representation using tabular or descriptive fallbacks for VoiceOver users, ensuring comprehensive understanding of chart trends.
    - Ensure chart legends are navigable and descriptive for accessibility tools.
  </action>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Focus Order and Semantic Labels for Reasoning Trace</name>
  <action>
    - Audit all new UI elements, particularly within the Reasoning Trace view, for correct `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityHint`.
    - Implement `accessibilityAddTraits(.isButton)` where appropriate for custom interactive cards and `accessibilityAdjustableAction` for interactive controls.
    - Ensure a logical and intuitive focus order for the Reasoning Trace view, allowing seamless navigation via assistive technologies.
  </action>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: High-Contrast Mode Verification</name>
  <action>
    - Verify that the entire Stitch color palette and all UI components (`ThemeComponents.swift`) render correctly and maintain readability in high-contrast modes.
    - Adjust colors or component styling as necessary to meet accessibility guidelines for contrast ratios.
  </action>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- Verify that every interactive element has a valid and descriptive accessibility label and hint.
- Conduct thorough testing with VoiceOver to ensure all chart data is accessible and the Reasoning Trace has correct focus order.
- Test the application in high-contrast mode to confirm readability and visual integrity of the UI.
