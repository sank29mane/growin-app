# Phase 13, 14 & 15 UAT

## Overview

**Phase:** 13 (Live Integration), 14 (Model Mgmt), 15 (Stateful Chat & UI Stability)
**Goal:** Verify Live Trading Safeguards, LM Studio Model Management, and Stateful Reasoning.
**Tester:** User
**Date:** 2026-02-28

---

## Test Environment

**Setup Required:**
- [ ] Backend running (`./start.sh --headless`)
- [ ] LM Studio Server running on port 1234
- [ ] Xcode running the `Growin` macOS app
- [ ] `backend/.env` configured with `TRADING212_USE_DEMO=false`

## Test Cases

### Phase 14 & 15 - LM Studio Model Management & UI

#### TC-01: Dynamic Model Listing
- [x] PASS (Verified via backend proxy and curl)

#### TC-02: Model Loading & UI Stability
**Scenario:** User selects a new model and verifies no UI flicker.
**Steps:**
1. Select a new model (e.g., `google/gemma-3-27b`) from the dropdown.
2. Observe the loading indicator.
**Expected Result:**
- The UI displays "Initiating load..." then "Loading into VRAM...".
- **No Flicker**: The spinner remains steady and doesn't disappear until the model is fully ready.
- **Error Feedback**: If load fails, the exact server error is displayed.

#### TC-05: Stateful Continuity
**Scenario:** Verify local model remembers context via server-side session IDs.
**Steps:**
1. Select a local model (LM Studio).
2. Ask: "What is my total portfolio value?"
3. After reply, ask: "Based on that, what is my biggest holding?"
**Expected Result:**
- The model identifies the biggest holding without needing the portfolio data resent in the second prompt (uses `response_id`).

#### TC-06: Reasoning Trace Extraction
**Scenario:** Verify Chain-of-Thought extraction from local models.
**Steps:**
1. Ask a complex question (e.g., "Analyze my risk").
2. Check the reasoning trace in the chat bubble or console.
**Expected Result:**
- Reasoning content (CoT) is displayed separately from the final answer.

### Phase 13 - Live System Integration

#### TC-03: Live Trading Safeguard UI
- [ ] PENDING (Red banner and red input border)

#### TC-04: Trade Execution Interception
- [ ] DEFERRED (To be tested after UI/Model stability is 100%)
