# Plan 07-02 Summary - Documentation Audit

## Accomplishments
- Cataloged all root-level Markdown files.
- Audited logs and secondary directories.
- Created `02-DOCS_AUDIT.md` with detailed recommendations.

## Findings
- Several root Markdown files are redundant or obsolete (`AGENTS.md`, `TODO.md`).
- Core documentation should be consolidated into the `docs/` directory.
- Historical reports should be archived to `docs/history/`.
- Root log files and legacy databases are ready for deletion.

## Next Steps
- Move active documentation to `docs/`.
- Archive historical reports.
- Delete obsolete logs and files.
