<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Perform Deletions</name>
  <action>
    Delete the following files and directories:
    - Root files: TODO.md, AGENTS.md, audit.log, startup.log, growin.db
    - Directories: .abacusai/
  </action>
  <verify>Check that these files no longer exist in the root.</verify>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Consolidate Documentation</name>
  <action>
    Create directories if they don't exist: docs/history/, docs/future/, docs/learnings/
    
    Move files:
    - ARCHITECTURE.md -> docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
    - GSD-STYLE.md -> docs/GSD-STYLE.md
    - MAS_Strategy.md -> docs/MAS_Strategy.md
    - 2-UAT.md -> docs/history/2-UAT.md
    - CODE_MATURITY_SCORECARD.md -> docs/history/CODE_MATURITY_SCORECARD.md
    - FIXES_APPLIED.md -> docs/history/FIXES_APPLIED.md
    - IMPROVEMENTS.md -> docs/history/IMPROVEMENTS.md
    
    Move directories:
    - future/ -> docs/future/ (move contents)
    - .Jules/ -> docs/learnings/ (move contents)
    - adapters/ -> .gemini/adapters/
  </action>
  <verify>Verify files are in their new locations.</verify>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Archive Legacy Management Directories</name>
  <action>
    Archive or delete legacy management artifacts:
    - Delete: .abacusai/
    - Delete: .Jules/ (after moving contents in Task 2)
    - Archive/Move: .gsd/ -> .planning/archive/gsd/
    - Archive/Move: .agent/ -> .planning/archive/agent/
    
    Special case: Consolidate `.agents/` skills into `.agent/` if preferred, or keep as is if they are used by current tools.
    Based on audit: ".agents/ RETAIN - contains specialized skills. Should be moved to .agent/ or consolidated."
    Let's move `.agents/` to `.agent/` and update any references if possible, or just move to a safer location.
    Wait, the audit said `.agent/` should be archived and `.agents/` retained.
    Let's move `.agents/` to a more standard location like `.planning/skills/` or just keep it for now.
    Actually, let's just move it to `.agent/` (the new one) if we want to clean up.
    Correction: Let's move `.agents/` to `.agent/` after cleaning up `.agent/`.
  </action>
  <verify>Check directory structure.</verify>

Check that the root directory is significantly cleaner and documentation is well-organized.

<success_criteria>
Codebase is clean, legacy artifacts removed, documentation consolidated.
</success_criteria>
