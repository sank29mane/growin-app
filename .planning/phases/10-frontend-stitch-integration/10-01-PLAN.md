<objective>
Translate initial Stitch-generated UI designs into reusable SwiftUI components and map their data requirements to existing backend data models.
</objective>

<tasks>

<task type="auto" status="completed">
  <name>Task 1: Define Core UI Components from Stitch Designs</name>
  <action>
    - Review Stitch outputs for "Growin Bento Glass Portfolio" and "Growin Liquid Bento Dashboard".
    - Implement base SwiftUI components for "Liquid Glass" effects, such as `GlassCard`, adapting existing `ThemeComponents.swift`.
    - **SOTA Task**: Implement `ReasoningChip` and `LogicTreeItem` components for progressive disclosure.
    - **SOTA Task**: Implement `ConfidenceIndicator` with dynamic visual states (Solid/Dashed) based on AI certainty.
    - Create/refine `PremiumButton`, `AgentStatusBadge`, and `FinancialMetricView` to match Stitch's aesthetic and functional density.
    - Ensure all components are reusable and adhere to the "Calm UI" and "Bento Grid" principles.
  </action>
</task>

<task type="auto" status="completed">
  <name>Task 2: Map Frontend UI Data Models</name>
  <action>
    - Analyze the data displayed in the Stitch designs (e.g., portfolio performance, asset allocation, key metrics) for the dashboard.
    - **SOTA Task**: Define `ReasoningStep` and `AgentEvent` models in `Growin/CoreModels.swift` to support the AG-UI streaming protocol.
    - **SOTA Task**: Add `confidence: Double` and `confidenceState: ConfidenceState` to relevant strategy and metric models.
    - Verify alignment with existing data structures in `Growin/CoreModels.swift`.
    - Update `Growin/CoreModels.swift` and `backend/schemas.py` if new fields or types are required to support the dynamic data.
    - Ensure efficient data flow for real-time updates without compromising 120Hz performance.
  </action>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- **Code Review**: Verify that new SwiftUI components are modular, reusable, and visually match Stitch designs.
- **Data Model Alignment**: Confirm that `Growin/CoreModels.swift` accurately reflects the data requirements of the new UI and aligns with `backend/schemas.py`.
- **Compile & Initial Render**: Ensure the application compiles without errors and the new components can be rendered.
