- **Current Wave:** Wave 1 (Foundation Tasks)
- **Context Threshold:** PEAK (0-30%) - Fresh Session Started

## Verification Snapshot
- `PROJECT_RULES.md`: Core rules reviewed and understood.
- `GSD-STYLE.md`: Styling and phrasing rules verified.
- `.gsd/SPEC.md`: Created and set to FINALIZED.
- `.gsd/ROADMAP.md`: Configured with current phases mapped from README.

## Immediate Next Actions (TODO)
- Create the `.agent/workflows/gsd-setup.md` script.
- Verify directories using `ls -la .gsd` and `ls -la .agent/workflows`.

## Risks/Debt
- None currently. Basic scaffolding is isolated from the React/Python systems.
