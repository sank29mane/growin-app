# Session Handoff: 2026-02-24

## 📍 Current Position
- **Phase**: 05 - Research Augmentation
- **Wave**: 1 (Completed), ready for Wave 2
- **Status**: LM Studio Client optimized; Research workflows integrated.

## ✅ Accomplished This Session
- **LM Studio Client Refactor**:
  - Implemented the **60% RAM rule** for M4 Pro memory safety using `psutil`.
  - Added an `asyncio.Semaphore` to manage concurrent predictions and prevent swapping.
  - Enabled **Content-Based Prefix Caching** (`cache_prompt: True`) for significant TTFT reduction.
- **Workflow Integration**:
  - Updated `.agent/workflows/pause.md` and `.agent/workflows/resume.md` to include research update prompts.
- **Deep Research**:
  - Initiated SOTA research on intraday stock prediction and M4 NPU/AMX optimizations via NotebookLM.

## 🚧 In-Progress & Remaining Work
- **Plan 05-01 (Verification)**: Need to query the "Growin Research" notebook to confirm new findings.
- **Plan 05-02 (Wave 2)**: 
  - Upgrade `DecisionAgent` to 'Lead Financial Trader' persona.
  - Implement parallel tool/specialist consultation bursts using the new `batch_chat` capability.
- **Plan 05-03 (Wave 3)**:
  - Enhance knowledge base with deep financial RAG for abstract reasoning.
  - Perform final performance benchmarking for TTFT gains.

## 🧠 Decisions & Rationale
- **Memory Safety**: Chose `psutil` for dynamic RAM detection. Set conservative limits (8GB model baseline, 0.5GB KV cache per slot) to ensure stability on M4 Pro.
- **Prefix Caching**: Explicitly added `cache_prompt: True` to the OpenAI-compatible payload to leverage LM Studio 0.4.0+ performance features.

## 🛑 Blockers
- None.

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. Run `/notebook_query` on notebook `7bcfaf55-e1ab-4e55-9a96-991af9d2921e` to extract SOTA findings.
2. Execute `05-02-PLAN.md` to upgrade the Decision Agent.
