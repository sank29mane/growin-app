# Session Handoff - 2026-02-25

## Current Context
**Phase:** 09 - Frontend Performance & Design Foundation  
**Status:** Planning / Research  
**Position:** Initializing visual overhaul and 120Hz optimization.

## Accomplishments
- **Phase 08 Completed**: SOTA tamper-evident audit logging, SSE streaming, and Dependency Injection refactor are finished and verified.
- **Phase 09 Scaffolding**: Created `SPEC.md` and initial plans (`09-01`, `09-02`, `09-03`) for performance and UI standardization.
- **PRs Merged**: All pending PRs (#83, #84, #85, #86) merged and reconciled with the main branch.
- **Research Initiated**: Started deep research into SOTA 2026 UI/UX patterns for financial apps (maximum context speed, realtime charts).

## Remaining Work
- **Visual Overhaul**: Integrate user's request for a major UI redesign (Trading 212 style) into Phase 09 plans.
- **Plan 09-01**: Execute 120Hz rendering optimization using `drawingGroup()` and hierarchy flattening.
- **Plan 09-03**: Build the "Reasoning Trace" UI component.
- **Stitch Integration**: Use Stitch MCP to generate/enhance the new UI screens.

## Decisions & Blockers
- **Decisions**: 
  - Accessibility audit (`09-02`) deferred to focus on performance and visual overhaul.
  - Using `uv` for all Python/dependency operations.
- **Blockers**: Need to finalize the query to NotebookLM to extract actionable SOTA 2026 UI patterns (previous queries were interrupted/denied).

## Next Steps
1. Re-run the NotebookLM research query for SOTA 2026 financial UI patterns.
2. Update Phase 09 `SPEC.md` and `Plans` based on the research and user's "visual overhaul" request.
3. Use Stitch MCP (`list_screens`, `edit_screens`) to start the dashboard redesign.
