# Session Handoff: Growin App

**Date:** Monday, 23 February 2026
**Last Activity:** Completed Phase 02 Core UI Overhaul and Backend Test Resuscitation

---

## 📍 Current Position
- **Phase:** 02 - Frontend & Telemetry Integration
- **Status:** Core UI overhaul complete; Test suite healthy (122/122 passed).
- **Active Task:** Transitioning to real-time telemetry integration.

## ✅ Completed in This Session
- **Stitch Design System**: Established deep charcoal/neon palette and premium typography across the app.
- **UI Overhaul**: Redesigned Goal Planner (responsive sidebar), Dashboard, Portfolio, Stock Charts, and Intelligent Console.
- **State Management**: Migrated core ViewModels to Swift `@Observable` macro for high performance.
- **Test Suite Resuscitation**: Fixed 42 test failures; achieved 100% pass rate (122/122).
- **Logic Robustness**: Fixed DuckDB bulk insert bugs and improved ticker normalization for UK stocks.

## 📝 Remaining Work
- **Live Telemetry**: Update chat stream to emit real-time agent execution events.
- **Observability UI**: Connect the "Real-time Neural Pathway" diagram to live backend telemetry.
- **Docs**: Finalize telemetry trace schema documentation.
- **E2E Verification**: Proceed to Phase 4 for final deployment readiness checks.

## 🧠 Key Decisions
- Standardized on **Stitch Neon Indigo/Cyan/Purple** for agent-specific color coding.
- Enforced **Decimal-based arithmetic** throughout the financial engine to eliminate float errors.
- Isolated test environment by cleaning up global `sys.modules` mocks in `conftest.py`.

## 🚧 Blockers/Concerns
- **None**. The system is in a highly stable and visually complete state.

## 🚀 Resume Instructions
1. Run `uv run pytest backend/tests` to confirm the healthy state.
2. Begin implementing real-time telemetry events in `backend/routes/chat_routes.py`.
3. Update `AgentClient.swift` to handle new telemetry meta-events.
