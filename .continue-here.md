# Continue Here: Phase 18 Complete

**Session Pause Date:** 2026-03-01 19:35 UTC
**Current Phase:** 18 - Adversarial Reasoning & Institutional Alpha
**Status:** Phase 18 COMPLETE (Waves 1, 2, and 3)

## 🎯 Current Position
Work has successfully concluded on Phase 18. All waves (Institutional Intelligence, Adversarial Reasoning, and Alpha Audit) are implemented and verified. The Multi-Agent System (MAS) has been flattened and hardened with a Critic pattern and performance tracking.

## ✅ Recently Completed
- **Phase 16 (Architecture Evolution)**: Flattened hierarchy with `OrchestratorAgent`, implemented 8-bit AFFINE optimization for M4 Pro, and enforced HITL trade gates.
- **Phase 17 (Operational Verification)**: Verified E2E HITL flow, implemented DuckDB-based telemetry persistence, and upgraded `WhaleAgent` to version 2.0 with bellwether aggregation.
- **Phase 18 (Wave 1 - Verified Intelligence)**: Integrated LSE RNS and SEC news into `ResearchAgent` with high-conviction weighting (2x). Enhanced `WhaleAgent` with SEC EDGAR 13F holdings.
- **Phase 18 (Wave 2 - Adversarial Reasoning)**: Implemented multi-turn debate between `Orchestrator` and `RiskAgent` (The Contrarian). Added ACE (Adversarial Confidence Estimation) scoring.
- **Phase 18 (Wave 3 - Alpha Audit)**: Built DuckDB correlation logic to measure agent P&L performance (Agent Alpha) over 1d/5d horizons and feed it back to the Orchestrator.

## 📋 Remaining Work
- **Phase 19 (Proposed)**: Agentic Strategy Revision & Dynamic Weighting.
    - Proactive "Stitching" of specialist trajectories.
    - Dynamic weighting of agents based on historical alpha.
    - Sentiment swarms for sub-second monitoring.

## 💡 Key Decisions & Context
- **Flattened Architecture**: The `Coordinator` and `DecisionAgent` were merged into a single `OrchestratorAgent` to reduce latency and coherence loss.
- **8-bit AFFINE**: Benchmark confirmed ~35% throughput increase on Apple Silicon NPU vs standard 4-bit.
- **Critic Pattern**: Mandatory `RiskAgent` audit is the final gate before any strategy is returned to the user.
- **DuckDB for Telemetry**: DuckDB is used for low-latency OLAP queries on reasoning traces and alpha correlation.

## 🚀 How to Resume
1. Run `/gsd:state` to verify current project memory.
2. Run `/gsd:execute-phase 19` (after planning) to begin the next evolution.
3. Test current MAS robustness with `PYTHONPATH=backend uv run python backend/main.py` and interacting with the chat.
